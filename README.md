# Target-Victim-Rescue-Robot
This repository consits of a colloborative ongoing project of a coursework and the codes are not fully developed.

## Overview
The project consists in rescuing some victims using a single robot. While the order in which the victims are rescued does not matter, they have to be rescued within a time limit. Each victim is associated with a value and the higher the total value of the rescued victims, the better it is.
- **Assumptions**
  - While victims are circles of radius 0.5m, the robot must pass though the center of the circle in order to rescue them.
  - The robot does not need to stop to rescue e victim.
  - The robot and the victims are initially deployed in random positions.
  - Since robots move at constant velocity, they must not stop or slow down.
